# Smaller Projects
This repository contains some of the side projects I completed in the last couple of years as a part of, or alongside, my studies. 

- **ML and Neural Nets** is about Classical ML, and mostly my evaluation of diverse models in diverse contexts, focusing on evaluation quality and visualization; NNs are all about architectures, presenting a nice CNN and a Siamese NN;

- **Programming Projects** (right now) hold my oldest work here, my C homework, that I'm still proud of (I did enjoy those pointers);

- **RL Agents** include two advanced RL agents trained to interact within simulated environments;

- **Teaching** is an important piece, as teaching Psychology students about AI taught me a lot about presenting abstract concepts to non-technical audiences; also include my seminar lectures for the Formela Lab about Multi-agent RL

- **Psychology In AI** contains my critical analysis of various topics/issues in the interdisciplinary intersection
